# SWIFTDOCS-19-nested-types
Swift documentation → Enumerations are often created to support a specific class or structure’s functionality. Similarly, it can be convenient to define utility classes and structures purely for use within the context of a more complex type. To accomplish this, Swift enables you to define nested types, whereby you nest supporting enumerations, classes, and structures within the definition of the type they support.
